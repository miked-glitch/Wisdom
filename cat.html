        <p>Born in 1957 in Saudi Arabia, bin Laden was the son of a wealthy Saudi businessman.

Following the Soviet Union’s invasion of Afghanistan in late 1979, bin Laden began providing financial and logistical support to the Islamic fighters battling the Soviets. 

In 1988, after Soviet forces were defeated and withdrew from Afghanistan, bin Laden founded an organization called al Qaeda, or “the Base,” to continue the cause of jihad (holy war) through violence and aggression.

Al Qaeda soon began raising money, setting up training camps, and providing military and intelligence instruction in such areas as Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Sudan. Under bin Laden’s direction, al Qaeda started launching attacks and bombings in various nations to further its violent aims.

During this time, bin Laden was becoming increasingly hostile to the United States. In particular, he opposed the U.S. military presence in Saudi Arabia and Somalia and sought to drive our nation’s personnel out of these areas by force.

After centering his operations in Sudan in the early 1990s, bin Laden began formulating plans to attack the West with an evolving, deadly new brand of jihad.

Bin Laden and other members of al Qaeda also began issuing fatwas—rulings on Islamic law—indicating that attacks on the U.S. and its citizens were both proper and necessary. Bin Laden later openly declared war on the United States.Investigators going through the rubble following the bombing of the World Trade Center on February 26, 1993.

Initial Attack on U.S. Soil 
On February 26, 1993, Ramzi Yousef—a young extremist who had trained in one of bin Laden’s camps—led the first major Middle Eastern terrorist attack on American soil by planting a truck bomb beneath the World Trade Center. The plan to topple both towers failed, but six people were killed and more than a thousand were injured.

Following the connections, investigators soon uncovered and foiled a second terrorist plot to bomb a series of New York landmarks.

The FBI also learned that Yousef was planning more attacks—including the simultaneous bombing of a dozen U.S. international flights—in concert with his uncle, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who later joined al Qaeda. 

Ultimately, Yousef was captured and multiple terrorist operatives were arrested and imprisoned for the World Trade Center bombing, deepening bin Laden’s disdain for America.

In approximately 1996, bin Laden and his supporters returned to Afghanistan, where an alliance with the Taliban government provided a secluded safe haven for al Qaeda to train recruits and plan attacks.</p>
